        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Packed with flavor, these Rueben sandwiches are the perfect quick and easy meal for a busy fall night.
            Recipe creator COLETTE G. likes to serve the sandwiches with dill pickles and a bowl of vegetable soup. Many
            reviewers like to use a George Foreman grill to make these sandwiches so it eliminates the need for
            flipping, which can get messy.
